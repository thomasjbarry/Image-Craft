Image-Craft
===========

Bugs:

	LayerTree- doesn't repaint drawing area upon deleting a SimpleHistory object
	Export- If no file extension is written in the filename the file will not save
	Shapes- redraws the entire drawing area making it choppy

TODO:

	ZACH: Shapes Bug (layered JPanels), More efficient Fill Tool

	THOMAS: LayerTree bugs, LayerTree icons (make it look better)

	DREW: Easel: make components clickable outside of where it is colored
